## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

My goal for this website was for it to have a clean design and be light on resource use, since its function is as a hub to connect to my different personal accounts and a curated selection of my projects.

## Optimizations

To the ends mentioned, I decided to make the website static, relying only on HTML and CSS, and foregoing the use of frameworks.

## Lessons Learned:

In preparation of my final design, I researched other developers' personal pages to draw inspiration. I found many original and beautiful designs, from which I borrowed some ideas. Overall, I appreciated most the sites that had a clean design and offered a smooth experience.
